Psuedocode: Robot leaves the room.

A robot is in the middle of a room. The objective is to write general instructions for the robot to leave the room. There is at least one door that swings outward.
The robot cannot create or destroy its surroundings.
The robot can detect if there is an object in the adjancent square foot.
The robot locomotion is two dimensional. It does not fly.

I imagine that the robot is on a x,y axis at the orgin position where "forward/backward" is increments and decrements y respectfully. Also, x position change is "left/right" which decrements and increments respectfuflly.
